Create a fully functional, frontend-only website for a Hinglish-themed coding school named "CodePeCharcha", using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React (without TypeScript). The design should be inspired by sheryians.com but must be visually unique, youth-friendly, and community-focused. Use a bold, vibrant color palette (such as purple, gradient blue, neon accents) with a catchy yet clean and simple background that enhances visibility. The website must be responsive, animated, and organized with clean folder structure (components/, pages/, assets/images/, styles/, data/) where all coding-related images (like laptops, devs, terminals, coding posters) are stored in a dedicated folder like assets/images/. Include smooth modern animations using CSS transitions, Framer Motion, or AOS.js, with Hinglish-style interactive UI elements (e.g., emoji-rich CTAs, “Charcha in progress...” loader). The website must include exactly 5 pages:

Home Page: Includes a hero section with a powerful heading (e.g., “Welcome to CodePeCharcha”), a Hinglish subheadline like “Jahaan hoti hai coding ki asli baat”, CTA buttons such as “🚀 Explore Courses” and “☕ Join Internship”, social media links (Instagram, GitHub, LinkedIn), a latest content slider (blogs/videos), and a newsletter signup section or call-to-action (e.g., “📨 Subscribe to Charcha”). Add animated transitions on scroll, hover effects on buttons and cards, and floating decorative shapes or SVGs in the background.

Products/Services Page: Show all offerings like online courses (Frontend, Backend, Full Stack), internship programs, and merch (t-shirts, mugs, stickers) using interactive cards. Each product must have hover animations, and there should be filter controls (e.g., by category or price) with animated transitions. Enhance UI with glow effects, button animations, and sliding entry effects.

Product/Service Detail Page: Clicking any offering opens a detailed page with product/course image, full description, duration or price, and a clear call-to-action button like “Enroll Now” or “Buy Now”. Page should include entrance animation, image transitions, and a CTA interaction animation.

Login/Signup Page: Must have a visually appealing authentication UI with floating labels, email/password inputs, password visibility toggle, “Remember Me” checkbox, and animated feedback on input focus and submission. Firebase authentication is optional; dummy logic using React state is acceptable. Include icons or emojis for form fields and animated success/fail alerts.

About Page: Feature the founder’s background and journey in a creative Hinglish tone. Include a scroll-animated timeline showing milestones, and a testimonial section with user photos, quotes, and ratings. Use animation effects like fade-in, slide reveal, or scale on scroll.

The overall tone of the website should be quirky yet professional, rooted in desi developer culture with Hinglish content, emojis, interactive buttons, and animations. The UI should reflect energy, approachability, and modernity — perfect for young students, interns, and aspiring devs across India.
